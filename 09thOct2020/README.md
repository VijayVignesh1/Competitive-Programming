## Serialize And Deserialize Binary Tree (October LeetCode Challenge: Day 9)

Serialization is converting a data structure or object into a sequence of bits so that it can be stored in a file or memory buffer, or transmitted across a network connection link to be reconstructed later in the same or another computer environment. <br>

Design an algorithm to serialize and deserialize a binary search tree. There is no restriction on how your serialization/deserialization algorithm should work. You need to ensure that a binary search tree can be serialized to a string, and this string can be deserialized to the original tree structure. <br>

The encoded string should be as compact as possible. <br>

### Example 1:
```
Input: root = [2,1,3]
Output: [2,1,3]
```

### Example 2:
```
Input: root = []
Output: []
```

### Constraints:
```
The number of nodes in the tree is in the range [0, 104].
0 <= Node.val <= 104
The input tree is guaranteed to be a binary search tree.
```
