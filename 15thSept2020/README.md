## Hamming Distance

The Hamming distance between two integers is the number of positions at which the corresponding bits are different. <br>

Given two integers x and y, calculate the Hamming distance. <br>

Note: <br>
0 ≤ x, y < 231. <br>

### Example: 
```
Input: x = 1, y = 4 

Output: 2 

Explanation:
1   (0 0 0 1)
4   (0 1 0 0)
       ↑   ↑
```
The above arrows point to positions where the corresponding bits are different.
